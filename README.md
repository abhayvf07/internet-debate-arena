# Internet Debate Arena

A full-stack debate platform I built using the MERN stack where users can create debate topics, pick a side (Pro or Con), post arguments, vote, and engage in structured discussions. It also has real-time updates via Socket.io, Redis caching, JWT auth, admin moderation, bookmarks and a trending system.

## Why I Built This

I always felt like online comment sections are just chaos — people talking past each other with no structure. I wanted to build something that actually encourages people to think and present their side clearly. So I made a platform where every debate has two defined sides and you have to actually argue for one.

Beyond the idea itself, this project pushed me to learn a lot of things I hadn't touched before — Socket.io for real-time features, Redis for caching, service-layer backend architecture, and proper JWT refresh token flows. It was challenging but I learned more from this than from anything else I've built.

---

## Key Things I Built Into This

- Real-time argument and vote updates using Socket.io
- Redis caching so the API doesn't hammer the database on every request (and the app still works fine if Redis is down)
- JWT auth with access + refresh tokens, SHA-256 hashed token storage
- Admin panel to manage users, debates, reports and bans
- Auto-calculated trending score based on votes, arguments, views and age
- Modular service-layer backend — controllers are thin, all business logic lives in services

---

## Features

### Authentication
- Register and login
- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs
- JWT access tokens (JSON body) + refresh tokens (secure HttpOnly cookies)
- Protected routes on both client and server side

### Debate System
- Create debates with title, description, category and tags
- Join on Pro or Con side
- Vote with toggle support — you can switch sides or remove your vote
- View trending and latest debates
- Filter by category or tag, with pagination
- Trending score auto-calculated from votes, arguments, views and how old the debate is

### Arguments & Discussions
- Post arguments under any debate (Pro or Con)
- Reply to arguments — supports nested threaded structure
- Real-time updates — new arguments and vote changes broadcast instantly via Socket.io
- Like arguments — authors earn points for every like they receive

### User Features
- Bookmark debates to read later
- Like / unlike arguments
- Report inappropriate arguments
- User profile showing stats — debates created, arguments posted, votes received
- Points-based leaderboard

### Admin Features
- View and manage all users with pagination
- Ban or unban users (invalidates their sessions automatically)
- Deep recursive cascade cleanup for deleted arguments (ensures no orphaned replies, likes, or reports are left behind)
- Handle user reports — view pending ones and mark them resolved
- Admin dashboard with platform-wide stats

### Performance & Security
- Strict environment variable validation at startup to prevent silent security downgrades
- Redis caching with TTL — auto-invalidated on writes
- App degrades gracefully if Redis is unavailable
- Pagination on all large data sets
- Helmet for HTTP security headers
- CORS restricted to CLIENT_URL only
- express-mongo-sanitize against NoSQL injection
- xss-clean against XSS attacks
- Rate limiting — 5 req/min auth, 50 req/min votes/likes, 100 req/min general
- Joi validation on all request schemas
- Clean, well-documented codebase with uniform docstrings
- Morgan HTTP logging + console logging
- Cloudinary for cloud avatar storage (via Multer middleware — auto-resized to 256×256, persisted on CDN)

## System Design & Architecture

When designing this platform, I wanted to go beyond a basic CRUD app and build something that felt snappy and could handle real traffic without immediately choking the database. Here's a high-level look at how the pieces fit together:

- **Client Layer (React + Vite):** The frontend relies heavily on `React Query` to cache server responses and reduce network waterfalls. Global state is managed via Context only where necessary (like Auth and Theme), keeping components modular and fast.
- **API Gateway & Routing (Express):** All incoming HTTP requests hit a robust middleware stack. This layer strips out NoSQL injection attempts (`express-mongo-sanitize`), sanitizes inputs (`xss-clean`), enforces rate limits (`express-rate-limit`), and validates data payloads (`Joi`) before they ever touch the database.
- **Service Layer (The Brains):** Instead of bloated controllers, business logic is completely isolated into a "Service Layer". For instance, `debateService.js` handles the complex trending score math, database writes, and cache invalidation. Controllers strictly handle HTTP Request/Response wrapping.
- **Real-Time Engine (Socket.IO):** To prevent constant long-polling, clients subscribe to specific "Debate Rooms" via Socket.IO. When a vote changes or a new argument is posted, the service layer emits an event exclusively to users viewing that specific debate, saving massive amounts of bandwidth.
- **Caching Layer (Redis):** Heavy `GET` endpoints (like trending debates or the user leaderboard) are wrapped in a Redis cache. If the Redis server goes offline, a custom graceful degradation fallback catches the error and queries MongoDB directly, ensuring the app stays alive without crashing.
- **Data Persistence (MongoDB):** The database relies on strict schema validation and aggressive indexing on heavily-queried fields (like `trendingScore` and `category`). Because arguments are deeply nested threads, a recursive cascading deletion algorithm ensures that when a parent argument is deleted, all children, grandchildren, and associated reports or likes are instantly swept from the database to prevent orphaned data.

## Getting Started

### What you need installed
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- Redis (local or Upstash free tier — optional but recommended)

---

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhayvf07/internet-debate-arena.git
cd internet-debate-arena
```

---

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `server/`:

```env
PORT=5050
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>
JWT_SECRET=<random-256-bit-hex-string>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<another-random-256-bit-hex-string>
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
```

Notes:
- `REDIS_URL` is optional — if you leave it out the app runs without caching and degrades gracefully.
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` are **required** for avatar upload to work. Get them free at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) after creating an account.

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev     # development with nodemon
npm start       # production
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:5050`.

---

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `client/`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5050/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5050
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev        # development — http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # production build → dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build locally
```

## What I Want to Add Next

- [ ] AI moderation to flag abusive content automatically
- [ ] Better debate ranking and scoring algorithm
- [ ] User reputation system with badges
- [ ] Push notifications for replies
- [ ] More detailed debate analytics
- [ ] Email verification on signup
- [ ] OAuth login with Google and GitHub

### Expert-Level Improvements (Future)

- [ ] **Single-use refresh token rotation** — Right now the same refresh token works for 7 days. Instead, every time a refresh token is used, it should be replaced with a new one. If someone tries to reuse an old token, it means it was stolen — so the server should log out the entire session immediately. This is how production auth systems like Auth.js and Supabase work.

- [ ] **Cursor-based pagination for arguments** — The current approach loads all arguments at once and builds the tree in memory. At scale this is slow. A better approach is to add a `path` field to each argument (Materialized Path pattern) that stores its full ancestry chain, then paginate top-level arguments using a cursor and lazy-load replies only when the user expands them.

- [ ] **Background job queue for trending scores** — Right now `recalcTrendingScore` runs on every vote, argument, and view — that's a DB read + write on every hot request. Using BullMQ (which runs on Redis), these recalculations can be pushed to a background worker with deduplication, so the main API stays fast under load.

- [ ] **Structured logging with Winston** — Currently the app uses `console.log` and Morgan, so logs are lost when the server restarts. Adding Winston with JSON-formatted logs, a unique `requestId` per request, and a remote log service (like Logtail or Datadog) would make it possible to trace and debug production issues properly.
